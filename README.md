# Django_BlogApp
This is my first Django app created using python. 
It includes various CRUD(Create,Read,Update,Delete) features of database along with other notable features like password reset using email.
Various user authentication methods are also an added feature.
Users can register using username,email and password.
Once they login with the registered username and password they can post new blogs, edit the posted blogs as well as delete the posted blogs.
They can also view there profile page to change the username and can update there profile picture.
Along with this there are several added features that represent proper functioning of a blogging app.
